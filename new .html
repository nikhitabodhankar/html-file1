    <p id="p2"><mark style="font: size 20px; ;"> <strong>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj </strong></mark> was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to be one of the
    greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. With his
    valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur.
    It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji implemented a competent and
    progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji
    is well-known for his innovative military tactics that centered around non-conventional methods leveraging strategic
    factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.</p>
    <h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
     <p class="p3 p4">Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the fort of Shivneri, near the city of
    Junnar of the Pune district. Shivaji’s father Shahaji was in service of the Bijapuri Sultanate - a tripartite
    association between Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. He also owned a Jaigirdari near Pune. Shivaji’s
    mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader Lakhujirao Jadhav and a deeply religious woman. Shivaji was
    especially close to his mother who instilled in him a strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji spent most of his
    time outside of Pune, the responsibility of overseeing Shivaji’s education rested on the shoulders of a small council of
    ministers which included a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), a Sabnis (Raghunath Ballal), a Dabir
    (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). Kanhoji Jedhe and Baji Pasalkar were appointed to train Shivaji in
    military and martial arts. Shivaji was married to Saibai Nimbalkar in 1640.
