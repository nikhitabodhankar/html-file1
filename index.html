    <p> Lee was the mastermind behind Spider-Man, one of Marvel's most successful characters of all time.     <br>
     He created the character with artist Steve Ditko in 1962, and they wanted to introduce a unique hero that people could
     relate to. To that end, they developed Peter Parker, a nerdy photographer who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and
     develops an array of superhero powers.

     The story has inspired many film series, comics, and TV shows over the years.
